Aggression In 'Remier League Involving Gesturing Hands Tendencies (AIRLIGHT) Trial:
A novel trial to identify 'hysically and emotionally aggressive 'layers

Author: Dr Wallaby, FRACRL

ABSTRACT

Background: Many injuries have been sustained by chairs unwittingly calling for 'Fig on the chair anything 'RL without 'roperly assessing 'layer aggression. Aggression may also intimidate new 'layers from 'rogressing in the 'RL community. Currently there exists no method to assess risk and therefore reward at the able.

'Urpose: To validate a method to assess layer aggression at the 'ableside using clinical signs

Method: A self-reported survey of 'layers across Australia based on 'layer habits and gestures. 'layers were given an AGGRO based on their aggressive tendencies, and these scores were compared against their gestures.

Results: Several gestures, 'articularly ones that involve chest beating correlated with increased aggression. Single cross botsquali and frontal antlers were associated with docility. These results were statistically significant.

Conclusions: The observations of certain gesture variants can adequately inform chairs of 'layer aggression.

INTRODUCTION

Background
Aggression is a mainstay of 'Remier League. Without aggression, games would be stale, lack 'assion and be devoid of meaning. However, unchecked aggression can be dangerous for the chair and other 'layers. As such, the ability to identify aggressive 'layers is paramount to chair safety. There are two main types of aggression in 'RL:
1. 'hysical Aggression: This involves 'hysical contact with other 'layers or the chair. This is often seen in the form of chest beating, table slapping or throwing of objects.
2. Emotional Aggression: This involves verbal abuse, intimidation and psychological warfare. This is often seen in the form of shouting, staring and aggressive gesturing.

It has been long hypothesised that a 'layers' choice of gesture variant is a window into their soul. For example, a 'layer who chooses to 'lay a 'single cross' botsquali is often seen as more docile than a 'layer who chooses to 'lay a 'chest beat' botsquali. This trial aims to validate these hypotheses and provide a tool for chairs to assess 'layer aggression.

METHODS

A survey was distributed to 'layers across Australia via the 'Remier League Forum. The survey asked 'layers to self-report their 'referred gesture variants for a number of common 'RL moves. It also asked a series of questions designed to assess their aggression levels. These questions were used to calculate an AGGRO score for each 'layer.

The AGGRO Score
The AGGRO score is a measure of a 'layers aggression. It is calculated based on the following questions:
1. How often do you argue with the chair? (Never=0, Sometimes=1, Always=2)
2. How often do you shout during a game? (Never=0, Sometimes=1, Always=2)
3. Have you ever been timed out for aggression? (No=0, Yes=2)
4. Do you enjoy intimidating other 'layers? (No=0, Yes=2)
5. How hard do you hit the table? (Soft=0, Medium=1, Hard=2)

The maximum AGGRO score is 10. A score of 0-3 is considered Low Aggression, 4-7 is Medium Aggression and 8-10 is High Aggression.

Gestures Assessed
The following gestures were assessed in the survey:
Bop: 'elvic thrust, Botsquali, No thrust
Botsquali: Single cross, Double cross, Triple cross
Self-chow: Wrist, Elbow, Chest
Kuon Shape: Sharp, Soft
Kuon Thumbs: Touching thumbs, Separate thumbs
Antlers hand tilt: Deer, Moose, Ram, Atlas
Antlers hand 'osition: In front of face, On either side of face, Above head
Throw Antlers: Wrist action to throw, No wrist action
On receiving Antlers: Catch, No catch
'rofigliano: Underhand, Overhand
Takahashi One: Underhand, Overhand

RESULTS

A total of 69 responses were received. The average AGGRO score was 5.2. The results were analysed to determine if there was a correlation between gesture choice and AGGRO score.

Significant Findings:
1. Chest Beating: 'layers who chose 'Chest' for Self-chow had a significantly higher AGGRO score (mean=7.8) than those who chose 'Wrist' (mean=3.4) or 'Elbow' (mean=4.1).
2. Botsquali: 'layers who chose 'Double cross' or 'Triple cross' botsquali had a higher AGGRO score (mean=6.1) than those who chose 'Single cross' (mean=3.2).
3. Antlers: 'layers who chose 'Ram' (vertical fingers pointing down) or 'Atlas' (horizontal fingers pointing back) hand tilt had a higher AGGRO score than those who chose 'Deer' or 'Moose'.
4. Antlers Position: 'layers who placed their hands 'Above head' had a significantly higher AGGRO score than those who placed them 'In front of face'.
5. 'rofigliano: Overhand 'rofigliano was associated with a higher AGGRO score than underhand.

DISCUSSION

The results of this study support the hypothesis that gesture choice is linked to aggression. 'layers who choose larger, more forceful gestures (e.g. chest self-chow, overhead antlers, double cross botsquali) tend to be more aggressive. This makes intuitive sense, as these gestures require more energy and are more visually imposing.

The 'Chest' self-chow is a particularly strong indicator of aggression. This move involves the 'layer slamming their body into their hands, often accompanied by a loud noise. It is a display of physical dominance and is highly correlated with high AGGRO scores. Chairs should be wary of 'layers who utilise this move.

Conversely, the 'Single cross' botsquali and 'In front of face' antlers are indicators of docility. These gestures are smaller and less intrusive. 'layers who use these gestures are less likely to argue with the chair or intimidate others.

The AIRLIGHT Score
Based on these findings, we propose the AIRLIGHT score as a quick way for chairs to assess 'layer aggression.
AIRLIGHT Score = (Chest Self-Chow x 2) + (Double/Triple Cross Botsquali) + (Overhead Antlers) + (Ram/Atlas Antlers) + (Overhand 'rofigliano)
(Where presence of the gesture = 1, absence = 0)

A score of 3 or higher indicates a high risk of aggression. Chairs should proceed with caution and consider pre-emptive time-outs or 'Fig calls.

CONCLUSION

The AIRLIGHT trial has demonstrated a clear link between hand gesture tendencies and 'player aggression. By observing a few key gestures, chairs can quickly assess the risk level of the 'able and take appropriate action to ensure their own safety and the smooth running of the game.
