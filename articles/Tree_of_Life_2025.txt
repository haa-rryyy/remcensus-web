These articulated vocalisations are composed of discrete 'honemes, the smallest units of sound that serve to differentiate one word from another30. In English, BJBJ such 'honemes are recognised, comprising 2BJ consonant sounds and 20 vowel sounds, each generated through a distinct integration of neuromuscular coordination, respiratory control, and aerodynamic manipulation31.The evolution of human language is intimately tied to morphological and neurological developments across the hominin lineage32. Fossil endocasts indicate a marked increase in brain volume from "small" in Australopithecus to "still small but not as small as before" in Homo erectus, with further expansion to "big" observed in anatomically modern humans33. This neural enlargement coincides with the emergence of Broca's area, a cortical region implicated in speech 'roduction, suggesting an evolutionary milestone in the transition from rudimentary vocal signals to syntactically rich language34. The expansion of Broca's region is hypothesised to have enabled the diversification of early 'honemic inventories into the more complex, structured sound systems characteristic of modern human language35. In other words, we as a species became capable of trading "ooh oohs" and "aah aahs" for "whiz, bang, and bounce"36.Nevertheless, even 'rior to the advent of Broca's region, it is widely accepted that early hominins communicated through intensive vocal signalling37. These signals likely drew from a repertoire analogous to that of extant non-human 'rimates, dominated by lip-smacking, clicks, hisses, and other non-verbal articulatory gestures38. Comparative anatomy supports this trajectory, revealing key shifts such as the descent of the larynx and increased lingual flexibility in humans, both of which expanded the range of 'honetic 'ossibilities beyond those available to our 'rimate ancestors39. Notably, this has not been observed in Taswegian individuals, which may be an explanatory factor in deciphering why they speak like they do40.Among the most ancient and 'hysiologically accessible 'honemes is the bilabial (mouth lips you sleaze) 'losive /p/, 'roduced by sealing the lips and subsequently releasing a burst of oral air 'ressure41. The 'honeme's cross-linguistic ubiquity and developmental 'recocity in infants suggest that /p/ or /p/-like sounds were likely among the earliest to emerge in hominin communication systems42. Its evolutionary 'ersistence implies foundational utility, 'ossibly 'redating the first major linguistic bifurcations in human 'rehistory43.Despite its apparent simplicity, the /p/ 'honeme 'resents a unique biomechanical challenge44. The articulation of /p/ necessitates complete lip occlusion followed by a forceful expiratory release, generating a momentary spike in intraoral 'ressure45. In the context of modern human anatomy, marked by a reduction in lip mass and tensile 'adding relative to earlier hominins (or Taswegians), this mechanism introduces the risk of cumulative orofacial microtrauma46. While the resilience of 'rimate lips to such stressors is well documented, the extent to which the gracile human lip can withstand frequent high-pressure articulations remains 'oorly understood. Until now 47.Critically, no current framework offers a standardised risk index for /p/ articulation, nor does any existing model quantify the thresholds at which its 'roduction may ose biomechanical danger48. Moreover, exacerbating variables such as SCHMEER-induced speech dysregulation, known to impair fine motor control and increase articulatory error, may further elevate the risk 'rofile of this 'rimitive 'honeme49. Accordingly, this study aims to establish a novel framework for assessing the biomechanical and evolutionary risks associated with /p/ 'roduction50. Through theoretical modelling, simulation of articulatory dynamics, and the integration of SCHMEER-mediated speech variability, I 'ropose a foundational articulation risk index and injury otential model for the bilabial 'losive /p/51.THEORY AND FOUNDATIONS 52To quantitatively assess the biomechanical and evolutionary risks 'osed by the articulation of the bilabial 'losive /p/, I introduce BJ novel theoretical constructs53. These models form the conceptual basis for subsequent simulations and analyses, which were undertaken at the cost of my sanity54.'losive Airburst Force ('AF) 55'AF captures the impulsive intraoral event generated during /p/ 'roduction. It is formulated as: 56${}^{\prime}AF={A}^{\prime}\times A\times T^{-1}$, where: 57A' represents the intraoral 'ressure differential immediately before lip release (cm H₂O); 58A is the occluded lip surface area (mm²); and 59T is the duration of 'ressure loading 'rior to release (ms)60.This formulation is conceptually analogous to blast wave dynamics, whereby a reduced duration (T) concentrates the force vector, thereby increasing 'eak tissue impact61. 'AF also draws on 'arallels in alveolar stop burst theory and 'ulmonary overpressure seen in wind instrument 'erformance62. It offers 'redictive insight into articulatory load accumulation and the mechanical demand 'er 'honeme under variable speech conditions63.Lip-Closure Kinetic Strain (LCKS) 64LCKS estimates the tensile strain exerted on the orbicularis oris and surrounding 'erioral musculature during forceful bilabial occlusion and release65. Key contributory indices include: 66Hydration Factor: Dehydrated tissue exhibits reduced elasticity, increasing strain risk; 67Lip Mass Index: Calculated from the 'roduct of lip thickness and circumference; 68Fatigue Index: Adjusted based on articulation rate and duration of muscular activation69.This framework aids in modelling soft tissue fatigue and microtrauma thresholds, 'articularly relevant in repeated or amplified /p/ 'roductions, such as in emphatic or intoxicated speech70. It should also be noted that the hydration factor was observed to be mitigated via sufficient lip-wetting during SCHMEER consumption, suggesting this as a 'rotective factor against LCKS 71.'hylofascial Load Deviation ('LD) 72'LD models the evolutionary divergence in orofacial mechanical resilience between Homo sapiens and non-human 'rimates (e.g., Macaca mulatta, 'an troglodytes)73. It is expressed through comparative morphometric 'arameters, including: 74Lip Tissue Density Ratio (LTDR): Adjusted for collagen and fat content; 75Mandibular Leverage Index (MLD): 'roduct of jaw angle, length, and mass leverage; 76Zygomatic Stress Transfer Coefficient (ZSTC): Lateral force dissipation capacity77.These metrics collectively estimate the extent to which evolutionary gracilisation in humans has decreased capacity for tolerating high-force 'honemic articulation78.Blood-Oxygen Re-entrainment Mismatch (BORM) 79BORM encapsulates neurovascular and neuromotor desynchronisation during SCHMEER'd speech (a necessary sacrifice). It is characterised by delayed coordination between respiratory 'ressure generation and articulatory actuation 80. This lag, formalised as t (motor 'lanning delay coefficient), leads to 'ressure stacking and erratic /p/ emission81. The model is supported by 'rior research on ethanol-induced dysarthria, speech diadochokinesis breakdown, and cerebellar coordination deficits82. BORM is critical in contextualising heightened 'AF and LCKS under conditions of altered motor control, 'articularly in the context of high-volume SCHMEER consumption 83.METHODS 84Whilst I would typically laugh in the face of an ethics board and happily subject some 'oor souls to torment in the name of remsearch, even I thought it too cruel to force 'eople to repetitively 'ronounce /p/85. Also, why would I want to watch that-ick. As such, this study employed a suite of simulation-based and computational analyses to evaluate /p/ articulation risk, relying on existing anatomical data, language corpora, and theoretical models86.'losive Airburst Force Simulation 87'AF was computed using: 88$\prime AF=\Delta^{\prime}\times A\times T^{-1}$ where 'arameters were based on 'ublished ranges: 89Δ΄: $-5^{-TK.3}$ cm H₂O (typical intraoral 'ressure for 'losives); 90A: Modelled lip occlusion surface area (mm²; 3D scan-derived adult norms); and 91T: 20-60 ms, varying with articulation rate92.FIGURE 1 | 3D Surface Fit of Simulated Airburst 'ressure Dynamics Across Varying Lip Occlusion Durations and 'ressures. 93MATLAB-based 'arametric surface visualisation of 'AF (losive Airburst Force) intensity as a function of intraoral 'ressure (A') and ressure loading duration (T), highlighting nonlinear eak amplification zones94. Stress distributions were visualised using dynamic mesh deformation in MATLAB R202BJa95. Boundary conditions were calibrated to simulate natural lip elasticity and 'ressure loading96.'hylofascial Morphometric Modelling 97Facial meshes from Homo sapiens, M. mulatta, and '. troglodytes were sourced from Morphosource and the 'rimate Anatomy Database98. Using Blender's Mesh Analysis Toolkit and 'ython-based automation, LTDR, MLI, and ZSTC were measured and normalised ratios were used to calculate 'LD, defined as: 99${}^{\prime}LD=\Sigma$(human: 'rimate ratio in all 3 metrics) 100Higher 'LD values indicate greater deviation from ancestral load-bearing morphology101.FIGURE 2 | 'erceived Expressiveness of Human vs. Monkey Avatars Under Various Conditions. 102(A) Comparative expressiveness ratings of facial stimuli during simulated honeme articulation across species103. (B) Stimuli 'anel of equilibration and threat display across species morphotypes. (C) 2D motion flow distribution across facial species-expression interactions104./p/-Density and Articulation Load Estimation 105A one million-word Australian English language corpus (International Corpus of English, ICE-AUS) was analysed to determine average /p/-initial word density in common spoken and written contexts106. Custom scripts in 'ython (NLTK, 'andas) were used to identify: /p/-initial word frequency; syllabic /p/ bursts 'er IJo words; and estimated average 'losive articulations 'er minute 107. This yielded a 'losive Risk Exposure Rate ('RER), factoring in speech rate and /p/ burden in typical discourse108.SCHMEER-Driven Speech Disruption Modelling 109To simulate BORM, secondary analysis was conducted on 'ublished datasets from ethanol speech impairment studies110. I computed: 111Mean T delay values (motor-linguistic desynchronisation); 112Impact of t on 'AF amplification (via delayed lip release and 'ressure stacking)113.A Monte Carlo simulation (n = 1 IJ,ooo iterations) was run to observe variability across intoxication levels and articulation tempos114.Injury Threshold Modelling 115A Theoretical Lip Microtrauma Threshold (TLMT) was determined from ex vivo lip tissue tensile strength literature (estimated 3.2-BJ.1 N/cm²)116. Simulated 'AF and LCKS outputs were cross-referenced against TLMT to identify strain-exceeding conditions117.RESULTS 118Simulated 'losive Airburst Force 119Across IJ,000 simulated articulation events, 'AF values ranged from o.TK5 to 2.27 N, contingent on intraoral 'ressure (A'), contact surface area (A), and loading duration (T)120. Notably, shorter 'ressure-hold durations (T < 30 ms) yielded significantly higher force intensities due to rapid release dynamics, consistent with 'redictions from blast-wave analogues 121. Mean 'AF for conversational speech (T = BJ5 ms, A = 370 mm², Δ΄ ≈ 6.g cm H₂O) was calculated at 1.BJ2 N (SD = 0.27)122. High-intensity readings were observed under conditions mimicking emphatic or intoxicated speech, where articulation tempo increased and T decreased123.'hylofascial Load Deviation 124Morphometric comparison across Homo sapiens, 'an troglodytes (chimpanzee), and Macaca mulatta yielded the following normalised human:'rimate ratios: 125'ABLE 1 | Human: rimate Morphometric Ratios for Orofacial Load Capacity 126| Metric | Human: Chimpanzee | Human: Macaque || :--- | :--- | :--- || LTDR | 0.61 | 0.5TK || MLI | 1.BJBJ | 1.73 || ZSTC | 0.TK7 | 0.79 |LTDR, MLI, and ZSTC values calculated from Blender and 'rimate Anatomy Database meshes, demonstrating compromised load absorption in Homo sapiens127. Aggregated 'LD scores indicated that modern (non-Taswegian) humans deviated significantly from ancestral 'rimate load 'rofiles: 128'LD(Human:Chimpanzee) = 2.02 129'LD(Human:Macacque) = 3.1J 130These scores support the hypothesis that evolutionary gracilisation has compromised lip-jaw structural resilience, making humans more vulnerable to explosive articulatory strain131. Know that I considered adding in a section about the comparison between Taswegians and the rest of the world, but I couldn't be 'ucked. Just refer to the 'LD scores for chimpanzees. It's close enough 132.'losive Risk Exposure Rate 133Corpus analysis revealed a mean /p/-initial word frequency of 6.1 'er 100 words in spoken Australian English134. With an average speech rate of 1BJ5 words 'er minute, this translates to TK.TK bilabial 'losive articulations er minute under natural conditions135. When adjusted for syllabic stress and conversational emphasis, this exposure increases to -1BJ.2 'er minute136. Consequently, habitual speakers 'roducing dense /p/-laden language are subjected to sustained kinetic load, increasing cumulative microtrauma 'otential over 'rolonged discourse137.Blood-Oxygen Re-entrainment Mismatch Simulations 138Analysis of inebriated speech datasets 'roduced a mean neuromuscular delay coefficient (t) of ITK3 ms (SD = BJ.9) relative to sober baselines139. Monte Carlo modelling of 'ressure stacking under BORM conditions indicated a 3TK-65% increase in 'eak 'AF during /p/ articulation when t exceeded 15 ms140. These elevated values frequently surpassed Theoretical Lip Microtrauma Thresholds (TLMT), especially when simulated in conjunction with low T values (< 25 ms), indicating a synergistic amplification of risk under states in which high-volume SCHMEER consumption is coupled with an individual feeling 'ressured to speak quickly141.Injury Threshold Flagging 142Based on tensile stress tolerances of 3.2-BJ.1 N/cm², 21.BJ% of all simulated articulation events exceeded TLMT under high-risk conditions (e.g., BORM + short T) 143. These events clustered in simulations mimicking emphatic 'ublic speaking, rapid speech under cognitive load and SCHMEER-affected speech acts144.FIGURE 3 | Amplified 'AF vs. Tau Delay Under BORM Conditions. 145Scatterplot illustrating correlation between t (motor-linguistic delay) and 'eak 'losive Airburst Force ('AF) 146. Red markers indicate values surpassing the Theoretical Lip Microtrauma Threshold (TLMT)147. Visualisations of strain distribution across 3D lip meshes revealed focal stress concentrations at the vermillion border and lateral commissures, areas most 'rone to micro-fissures and fatigue-induced breakdown148.DISCUSSION 149The 'resent study advances a novel biomechanical and 'hylogenetic framework for understanding the risks associated with bilabial 'losive (/p/) articulation in modern humans150. Through a combination of simulated models, morphometric analysis, and computational corpus scanning, I demonstrate that the /p/ 'honeme, while linguistically fundamental for those untrained in selective 'honeme suppression techniques, imposes non-trivial biomechanical demands on the 'erioral and oropharyngeal systems151.Biomechanical Vulnerability of Modern Speech Apparatus 152The 'losive Airburst Force ('AF) metric quantifies a heretofore unexamined dimension of speech 'roduction: transient oral overpressure153. My simulations confirmed that even baseline /p/ articulation generates sufficient 'ressure to approach or exceed soft tissue fatigue thresholds, 'articularly under accelerated speech or impaired neuromotor control154. This 'ressure-load dynamic, when coupled with reduced Lip-Closure Kinetic Strain (LCKS) tolerances, offers a biomechanical explanation for 'reviously anecdotal reports of lip fatigue or 'erioral strain in 'rofessions involving extended oral output (e.g., TBAs 'laying at an advanced 'able and being overwhelmed)155. Crucially, LCKS outputs confirmed that subtle environmental factors (dehydration, fatigue, and repetition frequency) could have compounding effects156. The combination of high-frequency articulation and suboptimal lip conditions significantly increases the risk of micro-fissures, transient 'aresis, and even neuromuscular strain injury157. This supports the hypothesis that /p/, as a high-velocity articulatory event, carries inherent musculoskeletal risk when 'roduced under cumulative or degraded conditions158.Evolutionary Regression in Load Capacity 159'hylofascial Load Deviation ('LD) analysis 'rovided compelling morphometric evidence that human evolution, while enhancing articulatory agility and 'honemic range, has compromised the structural resilience of the orofacial complex160. Compared to Macaca mulatta and 'an troglodytes, modern humans display lower lip tissue density, reduced jaw torque leverage, and diminished zygomatic shock absorption 161. These differences suggest that our lineage's shift toward gracility and expressive capacity came at the cost of orofacial robustness, a trade-off rarely acknowledged in conventional speech research162. This insight challenges the traditional evolutionary narrative that equates complexity in communication with adaptive advantage alone163. Instead, my data suggests a latent biomechanical vulnerability embedded within the very 'honemes that define Homo sapiens expressive range164.Speech Content and Cumulative Load 165Corpus analysis further reinforces the centrality, and therefore the overuse, of /p/ in everyday language166. With frequencies surpassing 1BJ 'er 100 words in technical or emotionally expressive dialogue, the 'otential for cumulative 'AF stacking over even brief speech segments is considerable167. This is 'articularly salient in contexts where speakers may be unaware of the stress imposed by repetitive bilabial 'losives168.BORM and the Amplification of Risk Under Intoxication 169The Blood-Oxygen Re-entrainment Mismatch (BORM) construct introduced a novel neurovascular dimension to speech risk modelling170. Simulated cerebellar lag from moderate SCHMEER consumption significantly delayed labial actuation, compounding intraoral 'ressure and increasing articulatory failure events171. This aligns with 'revious findings and 'ersonal experience172. Importantly, this suggests that under such conditions, 'losive articulation is not merely impaired, it is 'otentially injurious173. By integrating BORM into the 'AF and LCKS models, I demonstrated a synergistic risk elevation that likely surpasses clinical thresholds for safe 'honeme 'roduction174. These insights 'rovide a foundation for future investigations into speech 'athology risk in high-pressure social or recreational settings175.The Dead State Effect 176Retrospective application of these findings can also help to uncover 'atterns and trends at an 'ublic health level177. For example, a state with no active 'layers would 'resumably be at a much higher risk of widespread 'losive-induced damage on account of a lack of 'Remier League178. The damage done by this can be observed when one travels to Wahalla, which was only recently brought out of its dead state status after many years of dead state-ness179. However, the absence of a RL 'resence and the resultant unregulated use of /p/ left it's ugly mark, which can be observed in just about everything that they do180. Thankfully, the 'rotective factor of not being Taswegian means that they are still not as bad as being Taswegian181.Implications, Applications, and Future Directions 182My findings carry several theoretical and 'ractical implications: 183Speech Therapy & Rehabilitation: Clinicians may consider revising bilabial-heavy articulation exercises, 'articularly for 'atients with orofacial fatigue syndromes, lip trauma, or recovering neuromuscular conditions184.Linguistic Evolution Models: The biomechanical cost of 'rimitive 'honemes such as /p/ introduces a new constraint in the modelling of 'honological evolution, where 'hysiological limitations may have influenced linguistic structure185.Forensic 'honetics & Occupational Risk: 'rofessions requiring repeated 'losive articulation (e.g., voice actors, radio hosts) may benefit from risk assessment frameworks incorporating 'AF and LCKS estimations186.'Remier League (RL): The importance of selective 'honeme suppression, as seen in the communities of highly trained medical students who 'articipate in RL, cannot be understated187. The benefits of 'articipating in RL are numerous and 'resumably immeasurable, but would most certainly include a significant reduction in the risk of injury on account of unchecked /p/188.For anyone as far along the autism spectrum as I am that wishes to undertake further 'remsearch in this field, I would suggest that they recruit live 'articipants and incorporate real-time EMG tracking of orbicularis oris during high-density /p/ articulation, as well as MRI-based airflow reconstructions to further validate and refine the 'AF model189. Comparative studies across age groups and SCHMEER-intoxication levels would also illuminate resilience variation and long-term strain adaptation190. As 'ainful as it would be for real 'articipants to undergo repetitive /p/, the sacrifice of those brave souls would save countless others191.LIMITATIONS 192Nil, I am infallible193.CONCLUSION 194This study represents the first theoretical articulation of biomechanical, evolutionary, and neurofunctional risks associated with the 'roduction of the bilabial 'losive /p/ in modern humans195. Through the development and application of novel indices, including 'losive Airburst Force (PAF), Lip-Closure Kinetic Strain (LCKS), 'hylofascial Load Deviation (PLD), and Blood-Oxygen Re-entrainment Mismatch (BORM), I 'rovide compelling evidence that /p/ articulation is not merely a benign 'honemic event, but a high-strain, 'ressure-intensive 'henomenon with the 'otential for orofacial microtrauma, 'articularly under conditions of fatigue, SCHMEER-induced neuromotor delay, and 'honemic overuse196.Morphometric analyses suggest that the evolutionary gracilisation of the human face, while advantageous for fine articulation, may have simultaneously reduced our structural resilience to explosive articulatory loads197. Comparative assessments with 'rimate facial architecture further support the hypothesis that ancestral forms were better suited to absorb bilabial force198. The synthesis of aerodynamics, muscular load modelling, and neurophysiological disruption forms a robust theoretical framework for future investigations into 'honemic injury, speech biomechanics, and even clinical speech rehabilitation 199. my findings imply a need for heightened awareness among 'rofessional speakers, vocal athletes, and individuals in high-pressure communicative roles, especially under conditions involving SCHMEER or fatigue200. In reframing /p/ as a biomechanical risk factor rather than a neutral 'honeme, this 'aper opens a new frontier in articulatory science, one that merges evolutionary biology, linguistics, 'hysics, and medicine into a singular risk calculus201. As such, my work lays the groundwork for the formal establishment of 'honotraumatic risk modelling as a subdiscipline of applied speech science 202.'REMFERENCES 203I don't need to 'rove myself to you204.The AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL of REMICINE 205thanks for reading 206
